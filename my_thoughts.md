Perhaps the most dangerous men's pitfall
----------------------------------------

28.3 years - the average age of fathers in Canada at the time of the birth of their first biological child. Let's think about reasons and disadvantages of such type of public organization.

I want to start with pretty obvious graph:

All further argumentation are for those whose purpose on this planet is to be great, to create something new and to be remembered.

If you have a potential to be great, most probably you'll fulfill your purpose from 30 to 40 years. These years are most productive for man, and his responsibility is to use that resource with maximum efficiency.

From 15 to 20 we're trying to understand how females think and what they need. From 20 to 25 we already have a relationship, and if it lasts for several years, it's very hard to break up. The worst part of this is that your female partner most probably has the same age.

At the age of 27-29 female's brain enables I-need-to-make-babies mode, because humans anatomy tells us that birth after 30 can be dangerous for mothers. It's all true and makes sense from woman's point of view.

But.

Sperm is the same in 16, 20, 30, 40, 50 and even 90 years. Males, unlike females, don't have to hurry with their reproductive functions. But there's a relationship and most men don't want to break that relationship and therefore women's heart.

The main point is: you will loose your best years as a babysitter if you have not brave enough to break up.

--> With due respect to the other side of this argument, becoming a parent at a younger age has a wealth of advantages. 

Most important, young parents have the advantage of energy and youth. When you have a child at a young age, you are more than likely still able to run alongside your child, pick them up, spin them around, and do it all over again. You just don't have the same energy in your 20s 30s 40s or 50s. 

Also, as we age we tend to become more rigid in our perspectives. Maturity, in many cases, erodes the fun element of parenting. It becomes difficult to accept a new person in your life. 
And as young parents, you may be more adaptable and find it easier to deal with the changes and upheaval of parenting, as you haven’t had so many years to become set in certain routines and habits.

There's also a medical side of this, and more bad news for older dads: Higher Risk of Kids With Mental Illness

Apart from the obvious risks the mother carries, studies have shown that the genetic quality of sperm, as well as its volume and motility, all typically decrease with age and older men have a greater chance of fathering children with mental disorders.
The research found that children with older fathers were more often diagnosed with disorders such as autism, psychosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They also reported more drug abuse and suicide attempts, researchers said.

Let's fo back to one other challenges young parents face and that is that they feel they have not had enough time for themselves before their life became all about somebody else. If you are feeling that way, just remember that it won’t be forever. Kids do grow up, and you will still have time. 

Don't forget that relationships are proven not only to be good for our physical health, but our spiritual and emotional health as well. 

The more healthy, intimate connections you have, the more vitality you will have in your later years – and, research suggests, the more of those later years you will actually have. A review of 148 studies found that people with strong social relationships are 50% less likely to die prematurely.

Healthy relationships are what provide you with the sensation of being fully alive.

The world No.1 in tennis, Novak Djokovic, said: ""What it means to be a husband and also a father just added a whole new dimension of love and positive energy that I manage to convey and have transferred to the tennis court. It's helped. Ever since then I've probably been playing the tennis of my life. Being a father actually gives me more energy than it takes away.”
